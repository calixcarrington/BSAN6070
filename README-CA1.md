CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis – India Pollution Data

## Description
Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main
characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual
methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make
some sense of it. It’s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal
statistical techniques are applied.
